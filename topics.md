## Topics

<details>
  <summary>Public cloud Install videos</summary>

Coder [does document steps for each public cloud](https://coder.com/docs/coder/latest/setup/kubernetes), but it may be helpful to have 5 minute videos of each step, from start to finish.

This would initially exclude TLS and dev URL configuration, which can be separate videos.

</details>

- TLS setup video
- Dev URL setup video
- use Docker in a workspace to build images
- use Docker in a workspace to spin up containers with `docker-compose`
- connect to a workspace with JetBrains Gateway and `ssh`
- build a custom image with a JetBrains IDE
- debug a program in `code-server` e.g., PHP, Ruby
- Test a web app with a dev URL
- Test a web app with the Coder CLI and port forwarding
- Create a workspace template (Workspaces as Code)
- Update an image and notify workspaces based on that image
- Create a workspace application (additional icons in workspace)

## Format
- Videos take forever to make but if there is a really complex topic, a 5 minute video can easily explain it.
- Markdown files with text and screenshots would be a helpful addition to Coder's v1 docs.
